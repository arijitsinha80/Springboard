riserva mondiale negli ultimi mesi paesi emergenti hanno venduto un molti buoni del tesoro degli usa principalmente russia e cina anche arabia saudita inoltre per proteggersi dalle violente fluttuazioni del dollaro le banche centrali di diversi paesi acquistano enormi quantit di oro per diversificare le riserve valutarie breve l offensiva globale nei confronti del dollaro esplosa attraverso la vendita massiccia di debito degli stati uniti e parallelo l acquisto colossale di metalli preziosi rete voltaire citt del messico messico novembre fran ai espa ol la supremazia di washington nel sistema finanziario globale ha subito un colpo tremendo ad agosto russia cina e arabia saudita vendevamo titoli del tesoro degli stati uniti per miliardi di dollari secondo l ultimo aggiornamento dei dati ufficiali pubblicato da pochi giorni dal punto di vista generale gli investimenti globali nel debito pubblico degli stati uniti sono al livello minimo dal luglio chiaramente il ruolo del dollaro valuta di riserva mondiale ancora messo discussione nel l ammiraglio michael mullen presidente del joint chief staff statunitense avvert che il debito era la principale minaccia alla sicurezza nazionale mio avviso non tanto l alto debito pubblico oltre miliardi ad ostacolare l economia degli stati uniti per washington di fondamentale importanza garantirsi un enorme flusso di risorse estere ogni giorno per coprire deficit gemelli commercio e bilancio cio per il dipartimento del tesoro questione di vita di morte vendere titoli di debito nel mondo e co finanziare le spese degli usa si ricordi che dal fallimento di lehman brother nel settembre bank china ha subito forti pressioni da ben bernanke allora presidente della federal reserve fed non vendere titoli del debito degli stati uniti un primo momento cinesi decisero di mantenere il dollaro tuttavia da allora per due volta la pboc evitava di acquistare altri titoli degli stati uniti e allo stesso tempo avviava un piano per diversificare le riserve valutarie pechino acquista oro maniera massiccia negli ultimi anni e lo stesso fa la banca centrale della russia nel secondo trimestre del le riserve auree della banca di cina hanno raggiunto le tonnellate contro le tonnellate registrate nell ultimo trimestre del la federazione russa ha aumentato le riserve auree di circa tonnellate tra dicembre e giugno chiudendo il secondo trimestre di quest anno con un totale di tonnellate di fronte ai brutali scossoni del dollaro fondamentale acquistare asset pi sicuri come l oro che tempo di grave instabilit finanziaria agisce da rifugio sicuro quindi la strategia di mosca e pechino nel vendere titoli del tesoro degli usa e comprare oro viene seguita da molti paesi come stimato dal fondo monetario internazionale fmi le riserve auree delle banche centrali nel mondo hanno gi raggiunto il massimo degli ultimi anni registrando ai primo di ottobre un volume di circa tonnellate la geopolitica fa la sua parte nel plasmare il nuovo ordine finanziario mondiale dopo l imposizione delle sanzioni economiche al cremlino partire dal il rapporto con la cina ha avuto grande rilevanza per russi da allora le due potenze hanno approfondito legami tutti settori dall economia e finanza alla cooperazione militare inoltre assicurando la fornitura di gas alla cina per prossimi tre decenni il presidente vladimir putin ha costruito con l omologo xi jinping una potente alleanza finanziaria che cerca di porre fine una volta per tutte al dominio della moneta statunitense attualmente gli idrocarburi che mosca vende pechino sono pagati yuan non dollari co la moneta del popolo renminbi cinese emerge gradualmente nel mercato mondiale degli idrocarburi con il commercio tra russia e cina paesi che mio parere guidano la costruzione del sistema monetario multipolare la grande novit che alla corsa per la dedollarizzazione dell economia globale si unita l arabia saudita paese per decenni fedele alleato della politica estera di washington sorprendentemente negli ultimi mesi riad sbarazzata di pi di miliardi di dollari investiti titoli del tesoro degli stati uniti divenendo insieme alla cina uno dei principali venditori di debito degli stati uniti peggiorare le cose il regno saudita si accanisce sempre pi con la casa bianca fine settembre il congresso degli stati uniti approvava l eliminazione del veto del presidente barack obama ad una legge che impediva negli usa di denunciare l arabia saudita tribunale per il presunto coinvolgimento negli attentati dell settembre insieme l organizzazione dei paesi esportatori del petrolio opec ha raggiunto un accordo storico con la russia per ridurre la produzione di petrolio e quindi promuovere l aumento dei prezzi e anche sorprendente che giusto oggi pechino abbia aperto allo scambio diretto tra yuan e riyal saudita attraverso il trading system foreign exchange della cina cfets nell acronimo inglese per le transazioni tra le due valute senza passare dal dollaro di conseguenza molto probabile che pi prima che poi la compagnia petrolifera saudi aramco accetti pagamenti yuan invece che dollari se si accadesse la casa dei saud punterebbe
